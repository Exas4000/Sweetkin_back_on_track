# Sweetkin Clan Mod remake for monster 2

Join the Sweetkins as they return, this time on a trip to Haven! Now featuring rooms, equipments and a new unit type!

Sweet Cherry Sally leads the charge this time, as four years of timelines start to align back into one cohesive form.

Features 
    * 2 champions (Sally is back but Rosette isn't!)
    * 5 rooms themed around the Sweetkin's home dimension
    * 11 Relics (3 new relics since Mt1!)
    * 11 Equipments pieces
    * 23 units (with more to come!)
    * A new unit type comprised of 9 new units at release

Known bugs
    * Front Clerk's ability will softlock the game if used in a room with 7 friendly units (No space for more units!)
    * Lobby will continue to spawn units even in floors "destroyed" by bosses
    * Sherbetrus's root can cause a spawning boss to skip its floor if full on the enemy's side, causing that floor to not be "destroyed".
