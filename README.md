Support language: English | [简体中文](https://github.com/Exas4000/Sweetkin_back_on_track/blob/main/README_zh.md)

Join the Sweetkins as they return, this time on a trip to Heaven! Now featuring rooms, equipments and a new unit type!

Sweet Cherry Sally leads the charge this time, as four years of timelines start to align back into one cohesive form.

Features

* 2 champions (Sally is back but Rosette isn't!)
* 5 rooms themed around the Sweetkin's home dimension
* 11 Relics (3 new relics since Mt1!)
* 11 Equipments pieces
* 23 units (with more to come!)
* A new unit type comprised of 9 new units at release

Known issues

* Sherbetrus's root can cause a spawning boss to skip its floor if full on the enemy's side, causing that floor to not be "destroyed". (This is a known issue with the base game)

Credits!
